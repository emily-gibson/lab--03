# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The bars aren't in proportion to the number of speakers of each language (e.g. spanish and enlgish bars are similar in size but english has 300 million more speakers)





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

All in black and white, no numbers, representing two different pieces of data but its not clear what is representing what in the diagram 




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

No title so its unclear what the graph is showing, Has no key so we don't know why the balls are different sizes and colours, axes doesn't have a scale, Graph should maybe be larger/more spread out so the data is more clear 



## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

Y-axis label isn't clear, not clear how the graph is supposed to be read, X-axis scale isn't evenly spaced


# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

Wide format is when as the number of items increases, the number of columns increase and the number of rows stay the same whereas long format is when as the number of items increases, the number of rows increases and the number of columns stay the same 



Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

Wide

How many observations are there in the data set?

5


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = "1975":"2011", 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()
 

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()


```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
mutate(year = as.double(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() + labs(x = "year", y = "percentage of staff", title = "Percentage of staff in each faculty type in years between 1980 and 2010")




```

## Exercise 7
